**I want to add some new cryptographic techniques to this project and that is where I would need your help**
The techniques I would like to add are
1. Rail fence cypher
2. Morse code
3. Hill cypher
And eventually some more

**Step wise solution**
Let's tackle the first one first i.e., Rail fence cypher.
After implementing and committing to that we'll continue on to the next one.

**Let's do this**
As a beginner I faced some challenges along the way and learned a lot.
You can join me too. Let's learn together.
