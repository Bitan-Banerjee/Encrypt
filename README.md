# Encrypt

- This is a webapp that encrypts and decrypts messages using various cryptographic techniques in real time.
- The user needs to enter a key and a text (that he/she needs to encipher/decipher).
- The algorithm then computes and displays the encrypted/decrypted text on the screen.
- Feel free to visit the site -> https://bitan-banerjee.github.io/Encrypt/

### Cryptography techniques added as of  yet 


- Caesar Cypher
- Playfair Cypher

### Note

- I am trying to add new cypher techniques in the arcinal and that is where I would need your helping hand.
- To contribute to this project a person may need a basic knowledge in JQuery and Cryptography.
